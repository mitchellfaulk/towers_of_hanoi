# Description

The purpose of this project is to write a script that provides a playable version of 
Towers of Hanoi (in the terminal) using a class of stacks, that is also defined
in the code.

Place all three files (script.py, stack.py, and node.py) in the same directory,
and run the script.py file on the terminal (python3 script.py) to play Towers of Hanoi.
